   [App] QuantumSimulator created successfully
   ```
4. **Verify layout**:
   - ✅ Dark theme loads correctly
   - ✅ Header shows "Quantum Circuit Simulator"
   - ✅ Three tabs: Circuit Builder | Algorithms | Bloch Sphere
   - ✅ Gate palette on the right shows colored gates

---

### **Phase 2: Drag & Drop Testing** ⭐⭐⭐
1. **Test gate dragging**:
   - ✅ Drag **H gate** (yellow) from palette to grid q0, column 0
   - ✅ Gate should appear in grid cell
   - ✅ Drag **CNOT gate** (purple) to grid q0, column 1
   - ✅ CNOT should show control dot on q0 and target cross on q1

2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Drag preview should appear while dragging
   - Grid cells should highlight green when gate hovers
   - Gates should snap into grid positions
   - Connection line should appear between CNOT control/target

3. **Test gate removal**:
   - ✅ Double-click any placed gate to remove it
   - ✅ Use "Clear All" button to remove all gates

---

### **Phase 3: Bell State Creation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
1. **Create the circuit**:
   - Place **H gate** on **qubit 0, column 0**
   - Place **CNOT gate** on **qubit 0, column 1** (targets qubit 1)

2. **Run simulation**:
   - Click **"Run Circuit"** button
   - Watch for console output:
     ```
     [App] Running simulation with circuit: [...]
     [QuantumSimulator] Executing circuit...
     [App] Simulation successful, result: {...}
     ```

3. **Verify Bell state results** 🎯:
   - **|00⟩**: ~50.0% probability
   - **|01⟩**: ~0.0% probability  
   - **|10⟩**: ~0.0% probability
   - **|11⟩**: ~50.0% probability
   
   *(This proves perfect quantum entanglement!)*

### **Phase 4: Visualization Testing** ⭐⭐
1. **Simulation Results Panel**:
   - ✅ Current State shows complex amplitudes
   - ✅ Measurement Probabilities show basis states
   - ✅ Individual Qubit Probabilities display correctly
   - ✅ Execution Log records each gate operation

2. **3D Visualizations**:
   - ✅ Bloch Sphere updates (single-qubit states only)
   - ✅ 3D Circuit View shows placed gates
   - ✅ Probability bars animate correctly

---

### **Phase 5: Button Functionality** ⭐
1. **Test all buttons**:
   - ✅ **"Run Circuit"**: Executes quantum simulation
   - ✅ **"Clear All"**: Removes all gates from grid
   - ✅ **"Export Circuit"**: Downloads JSON file
   - ✅ **"Connection Mode"**: Toggle for custom connections

2. **Export test**:
   - Place some gates, click Export
   - Verify downloaded JSON contains circuit data

---

### **Phase 6: Algorithm Templates** ⭐⭐
1. **Switch to Algorithms tab**:
   - Click "Algorithms" in header navigation
   - Verify algorithm list appears

2. **Test Bell State template**:
   - Click "Bell State Preparation"
   - Verify it loads H + CNOT circuit automatically
   - Run and verify 50/50 results

3. **Test other algorithms**:
   - Quantum Teleportation (3 qubits)
   - Grover's Search (3 qubits)
   - Quantum Fourier Transform

---

### **Phase 7: Error Handling** ⭐
1. **Test edge cases**:
   - Try placing gates outside grid bounds
   - Try placing multiple gates in same cell
   - Run empty circuit (should show |0000⟩ state)
   - Switch between tabs while circuits are loaded

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **✅ MUST WORK**:
1. **Drag & drop gates** from palette to grid
2. **Bell state creation** showing 50% |00⟩ + 50% |11⟩
3. **Real-time probability updates** when circuit runs
4. **All buttons functional** (Run, Clear, Export, Connection Mode)
5. **No JavaScript errors** in console (warnings OK)

### **✅ SHOULD WORK**:
1. **Bloch sphere visualization** for single-qubit operations
2. **Algorithm templates** load and execute correctly
3. **3D circuit rendering** shows gates visually
4. **Export functionality** generates valid JSON

### **⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES**:
1. **TypeScript compilation warnings** (runtime unaffected)
2. **Multi-qubit Bloch sphere** shows default state (expected)
3. **Some drag edge cases** may need refinement

## 🧮 **MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION**

### **Bell State Test Results**:
When H + CNOT circuit runs, verify:
```
Initial state: |0000⟩ = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
After H on q0:  (|0000⟩ + |1000⟩)/√2
After CNOT:     (|0000⟩ + |1100⟩)/√2

Expected probabilities:
- P(|0000⟩) = 0.5 = 50%  ✅
- P(|0001⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅  
- P(|0010⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|0011⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|0100⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|0101⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|0110⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|0111⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1000⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1001⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1010⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1011⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1100⟩) = 0.5 = 50%  ✅
- P(|1101⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1110⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
- P(|1111⟩) = 0.0 = 0%   ✅
```
